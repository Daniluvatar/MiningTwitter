# Mining Twitter
An elegant way to gather tweets from Twitter using the Tweepy API http://docs.tweepy.org/en/v3.5.0/index.html

Design patterns are taken into action with this implementation.

A concrete implementation of the Singleton and Decorator patterns in Python 3 is used to encapsulate the complexity of Tweepy API
and to build a code which is closed for modification but open for extension.
