# Mining Twitter
An elegant way to gather tweets from Twitter using the [Tweepy API](http://docs.tweepy.org/en/v3.5.0/index.html)

OOP principles are used to encapsulate the complexity of Tweepy API. In addition, design patterns are taken into action in this prototype to create a robust code which is closed for modification but open for extension. 

A concrete implementation of the Singleton and Decorator patterns in Python 3 is shown.
